                In order to test my knowledge of 2D games on a real project, I fully 
                created a platformer game in Unity. I had to implement at least an idle 
                animation, a running animation, and a jumping animation. The platformer 
                gameplay had to include static obstacles, others that could be pushed 
                to progress, dangerous objects randomly falling from the sky, collectible 
                items (coins and power-ups), a user interface to quit and restart the game 
                in case of victory or defeat, another UI to display coins, health, and 
                collected items, as well as enemies chasing the player. Balancing was 
                handled through an interface in the pause menu that allowed modifying 
                different parameters.

			<b>Bokena</b> (a name inspired by “bōken” meaning “adventure” in Japanese) is a colorful pixel-style 
            game where the goal of each of its two levels is to reach the colored gem while collecting as 
            many coins as possible. Dash (forward leap) and double-jump power-ups have been implemented, 
            along with rare collectibles (Big Coins) to be found in each level. Two types of enemies can
            be found:<br><br>

			- <b>Slimes</b>, which can jump to chase you but can be defeated with a single stomp on their 
            heads.<br>
			- <b>Cave monsters</b>, slower than slimes and unable to jump, but tougher and stronger.<br><br>

			In <b>Level 1</b>, you start in sunny plains where power-ups and coins are easy to reach. Then, enter 
            the cave whose entrance looks like a jaw to find the colored gem (and other surprises...).<br><br>

			In <b>Level 2</b>, after continuing deeper into the cave, you’ll find yourself in its frozen depths. There 
            are three secret passages allowing you to obtain this level’s power-ups. You’ll discover even more 
            different paths leading to the goal in this stage. It’s in these icy depths that cave monsters appear 
            and stalactites may fall on you. Beware !

        <h2>BOKENA, A COLORFUL PLATFORMER<br>I LOVED DEVELOPPING</h2>

                Bokena felt like my very first real video game. Years earlier, I used to make small games on Scratch, 
                but I knew it was nothing compared to what could be done with more powerful engines. Thanks to Bokena, 
                I discovered what I was capable of in just two months of development. Working on the SFX, music, user 
                interface, level design, game design, and my programming skills in Unity was an absolute joy for me. 
                I only ran into minor difficulties. For example, I couldn’t quite create a knockback effect that I was 
                satisfied with when the character took damage. I ended up finding a compromise using Unity’s physics 
                system to overcome this problem.<br><br>

                After this project, I realized there were several areas where I could improve my code. Of course, it’s 
                by coding that you gradually learn more and more about good practices, and that’s exactly what this 
                project allowed me to do. I also became increasingly familiar with Unity along the way.<br><br>

                In short, I’m really happy I got to make this project — to make Bokena.
